# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

## Release & Changelog Rule

- Before publishing a new version, the local agent must ensure `[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml`, the `vX.Y.Z` release tag, and root `CHANGELOG.md` all describe the same version.
- Root `CHANGELOG.md` must contain only the newest version's changelog because the GitHub release workflow reads it verbatim as the GitHub Release notes.
- When a previous root changelog exists, move it to `docs/changes/CHANGELOG_<version>.md` before writing the new root `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Historical changelog files stay under `docs/changes/`; do not append old release history back into root `CHANGELOG.md`.
