# OpenTUI frontend

The `packages/hya-tui` frontend is a basic terminal client for a running
`hya-backend serve` process. It uses OpenTUI for display and input while the
backend remains the owner of sessions, event history, tool execution, and
permissions. It can use HTTP/JSON+SSE or native gRPC for the same v1 workflows;
gRPC connects to the backend's separate listener. The screen shows a session
list, the selected transcript, and
pending interactions. Models, Workflows, and saved provider keys have dedicated
views; the API command view exposes the other unary operations in `hya.v1`.
Tab completes slash commands using the TUI and server command catalogs.
One persistent instruction line stays below the input at the bottom of the
screen and changes with the current view.
If a backend predates the saved-key list endpoint, the main TUI still opens and
shows that key listing needs a backend restart with an updated binary.

## Start it

Requires Bun 1.3 or newer and a terminal supported by OpenTUI. From a clone:

```sh
cd packages/hya-tui
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run these in separate terminals from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p hya-backend -- serve --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --db "$HOME/hya-sessions.db"
bun packages/hya-tui/src/main.ts --server http://127.0.0.1:8080 --dir "$PWD"
```

`--server` is the backend base HTTP URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).
`--dir` is the absolute directory scope sent as `x-hya-directory` (default:
the frontend process's working directory). `--help` prints the launch syntax.
To connect over gRPC instead, start the separate listener and use `--grpc`:

```sh
HYA_GRPC_BIND=127.0.0.1:22104 cargo run --locked -p hya-backend -- serve --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --db "$HOME/hya-sessions.db"
bun packages/hya-tui/src/main.ts --grpc 127.0.0.1:22104 --dir "$PWD"
```

Run those commands in separate terminals. `--grpc` accepts a `host:port`
address and cannot be combined with `--server`; its port must match
`HYA_GRPC_BIND`. The gRPC client uses a plaintext connection, so keep the
listener on loopback or forward it through SSH when the frontend is remote.
The TUI sends `--dir` in the gRPC request's `directory` field where that
method defines one.
The backend's offline echo model is sufficient for a first run. The `/connect`
flow below configures a live provider from the TUI.

Type a plain prompt and press Enter. The frontend creates a session when none
is open, admits the prompt as a turn, and refreshes its transcript from the
server as SSE or gRPC frames arrive. For example, type `summarize this repository`,
then `/models` to inspect available routes, and `/open 1` to return to the
first session. Press Ctrl+C to exit and restore the terminal.

While a turn started from this TUI runs in the selected session, a dedicated
row above the status message animates and shows
elapsed time and the time since the last session event. For example, after
typing `hello` it may show `⠋ Agent working · 00:08 elapsed · last update 2s ago`.
After 15 seconds without an event it shows `No update for 15s` and the `/cancel`
hint. The animation shows that the frontend is responsive; event silence alone
cannot establish whether the model is thinking or a backend request is stalled.
If the turn-status request fails, the row says `Backend status unavailable` while
the frontend retries.
The row disappears when the backend reports the turn finished, failed, or was
cancelled, or when you switch sessions. Failures display the backend's error
message in the status row.

To set a provider API key, type `/key set anthropic`, paste the key into the
concealed prompt, and press Enter. The prompt draws bullets only and clears its
buffer after submission; Esc cancels. `/keys` lists saved provider IDs, and
`/key remove anthropic` deletes that provider's saved credential. The backend
stores the key in its user auth directory; it never sends existing key values
back to the TUI. OAuth login remains available through the backend CLI.
After typing `/keys`, read the bottom row for the `/connect deepseek` next step.
During
concealed entry, the row changes to `Paste API key · Enter saves · Esc cancels`.

### Connect DeepSeek from the TUI

The connection flow saves a non-secret provider route on the backend. It
connects the route to a saved key by matching the provider ID; it does not
copy the key into `config.yaml`. For the official DeepSeek OpenAI-format API,
enter these commands in the TUI:

```text
/key set deepseek
<paste your key into the concealed entry and press Enter>
/connect deepseek
<review the endpoint, models, default model, and saved-key status; press Enter>
```

The preset uses `https://api.deepseek.com` and offers `deepseek-flash` and
`deepseek-v4-pro`, with `deepseek/deepseek-flash` as the default. See
[DeepSeek's model catalog](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/)
for current model availability. Esc cancels the preview. Restart the backend
after saving, reconnect the TUI, and type `/models` to see the new routes.
Then start a new session with `/new`, or select `deepseek/deepseek-flash` in an
existing session with `/model deepseek/deepseek-flash`.

For another OpenAI Chat Completions server, use
`/connect custom <provider-id> <base-url> <model-id> [more-model-ids]`.
For example, `/connect custom lab http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 lab-model`.
Save its key first with `/key set lab` if it requires one. The first model
becomes the default after backend restart. `/connect` alone shows usage.

If `/keys` says key listing is unavailable, restart the backend with hya
0.37.6 or newer and run the same frontend command again. For example, a
frontend on `127.0.0.1:22103` can reconnect after restarting the backend on
that port; sessions and other main views remain available while its older
backend is running.

## Commands and keys

| Input | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Plain text + Enter | Admit a prompt in the current session; create one if needed. |
| `/new [agent] [model]` | Create a session in `--dir`, using the first visible agent and its model by default. |
| `/sessions`, `/open <id or number>` | Refresh or switch sessions. |
| `/models`, `/model <provider/model>` | View catalog or change the selected session model. |
| `/keys` | List configured providers and provider IDs with saved credentials; never display key values. |
| `/key set <provider>`, `/login <provider>` | Open concealed entry for a provider API key; Enter saves, Esc cancels. |
| `/key remove <provider>` | Delete the provider's saved credential. |
| `/connect deepseek` | Preview the official DeepSeek route; Enter saves it, Esc cancels. |
| `/connect custom <id> <base-url> <model-id> [more-model-ids]` | Preview and save an OpenAI-compatible route. |
| `/workflows`, `/workflow select <name>`, `/workflow run [name]` | View sources and selected state; select or start a Workflow in the selected session. |
| `/interactions` | View pending permissions and questions. |
| `/approve <id>`, `/deny <id>` | Respond to a permission request for this run only (`persist: false`). |
| `/answer <id> <text>` | Answer a question request. |
| `/cancel` | Request cancellation of the turn admitted in this frontend. |
| `/refresh` or Ctrl+R | Reload sessions, messages, interactions, models, and Workflows. |
| `/api` | List the v1 operations from the generated OpenAPI catalog. |
| `/api METHOD /v1/path [JSON]` | Send a scoped v1 request using the selected transport and show its response. |
| `/help` | Show command help. |
| Tab | Complete a slash command or supported argument; repeat Tab to cycle matches. |

The bottom instruction row is separate from the status message above the
input. Status updates and completion suggestions can change without erasing
the next-step instruction.

Other slash commands are forwarded to the backend as `CommandTurn`s, so
custom commands from the server catalog remain usable in this frontend. Tab
suggestions also use that catalog. Argument completion covers agents, sessions,
models, Workflows, pending interaction IDs, provider IDs, saved key names, and
v1 operations from the generated OpenAPI catalog. Suggestions are refreshed
with `/refresh` or Ctrl+R.

The API command accepts `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`; the optional
body must be JSON. `GET` has no body. Include query parameters directly in the
path. For example:

```text
/api GET /v1/health
/api GET /v1/sessions
/api PATCH /v1/sessions/hysec_... {"title":"Review"}
```

It only accepts paths beginning `/v1/`, so a command cannot redirect the
client to another origin. In gRPC mode, the path and HTTP verb select the
corresponding `Service.Method` RPC; path, query, and JSON body fields become
the protobuf request. The catalog marks server-streaming operations with
`[stream]`; the one-shot API command does not consume those streams. Session
SSE or gRPC events are connected automatically when a session is open. PTY
WebSocket sessions
need a WebSocket client; the command view can still call their JSON setup
routes. See the [protocol guide](protocol/README.md) for those frames.

## Interface definitions

The frontend uses HTTP/JSON+SSE with `--server` and native gRPC with `--grpc`.
Every HTTP request carries
`x-hya-directory: <absolute --dir path>`; JSON uses protojson lower camel case,
string encoded 64-bit values, and the error envelope documented in the
[protocol guide](protocol/README.md). gRPC uses the same lower camel case
field names at the TUI boundary, with the `hya.v1` protobuf request and response
messages as its wire contract. The table below gives each HTTP binding; gRPC
maps each binding to the `Service.Method` in the
[generated API reference](protocol/api-reference.md). These are the first-class calls:

| Method and route | Request | Response read by the TUI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/bootstrap` | No body | `Bootstrap` (`location`, `agents`, `models`, `interactions`) |
| `GET /v1/sessions` | No body | `ListSessionsResponse.sessions: SessionInfo[]` |
| `POST /v1/sessions` | `{agent: string, model: string, workdir: string}` | `CreateSessionResponse.session: SessionInfo` |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` | No body | `SessionInfo` |
| `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` | `{model: string}` | `SessionInfo` |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/messages` | No body | `ListMessagesResponse.messages: MessageInfo[]` |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turns` | `{prompt: {text: string}}` | `CreateTurnResponse.turn: TurnInfo` |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turns` | `{command: {command: string, arguments: string}}` for other slash commands | `CreateTurnResponse.turn: TurnInfo` |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turns/{turn}/wait?timeoutMs=5000` | `{}` while the local turn is active | `TurnInfo` (`id: string`, `state: TURN_STATE_UNSPECIFIED \| TURN_STATE_ADMITTED \| TURN_STATE_RUNNING \| TURN_STATE_FINISHED \| TURN_STATE_FAILED \| TURN_STATE_CANCELLED`, optional `finish`, `errorCode`, `errorMessage`). The TUI repeats a timed-out wait until a terminal state. The gRPC binding is `Turn.WaitTurn` with `WaitTurnRequest {session: string, turn: string, timeoutMs: uint64}`. |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turns/{turn}/cancel` | `{}` | `CancelTurnResponse` |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/events/stream?sinceSeq=N` | SSE | `StreamFrame` with `event` or `resync` |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/events?sinceSeq=N` | No body | `ListEventsResponse` on stream resync |
| `GET /v1/interactions` | No body | `ListInteractionsResponse.interactions: Interaction[]` |
| `POST /v1/interactions/{id}/respond` | `{permission: {allowed: boolean, persist: false}}` or `{question: {answer: string}}` | `RespondInteractionResponse.applied` |
| `GET /v1/models` | No body | `ListModelsResponse.models: ModelSummary[]` |
| `GET /v1/providers` | No body | `ListProvidersResponse.providers: ProviderSummary[]` for key suggestions. |
| `PUT /v1/providers/{provider_id}/setup` | `{kind: "openai-compatible", baseUrl: string, modelIds: string[], makeDefault: boolean}`. The path ID matches the saved auth ID; an optional body `providerId` must match it. | `{providerId: string, modelRef: string, restartRequired: true}`. Saves `providers.<id>.kind`, `base_url`, and `models` in backend `config.yaml`; when `makeDefault` is true, saves `default_model` as the first model. The runtime applies it after restart. |
| `GET /v1/commands` | No body | `ListCommandsResponse.commands: CommandSummary[]` for slash completion. |
| `GET /v1/auth` | No body | `ListProviderAuthResponse.providerIds: string[]` (saved provider IDs only; empty field omitted). A 404 marks key listing unavailable without blocking startup. |
| `PUT /v1/auth/{provider_id}` | `{apiKey: string}` | `SetProviderAuthResponse.status: AuthStatus`; key value is sent only to the backend. |
| `DELETE /v1/auth/{provider_id}` | No body | `RemoveProviderAuthResponse` (empty). |
| `GET /v1/workflows` | No body | `ListWorkflowsResponse.workflows: WorkflowSummary[]` |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/workflow` | No body | `WorkflowState` |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/workflow` | `{select: {name: string}}` or `{run: {name: string}}` | `SubmitWorkflowCommandResponse` |

The one-row footer sits directly below the input panel. Its content is selected
from the current view; it makes no HTTP request:

| View or state | Bottom instruction |
| --- | --- |
| Chat | `Enter a prompt · /new creates a session · /help lists commands` |
| Models | `Next: /model <provider/model> to switch this session · /help` |
| Workflows | `Next: /workflow select <name> or /workflow run [name]` |
| Interactions | `Next: /approve <id>, /deny <id>, or /answer <id> <text>` |
| Saved keys | `Next: /connect deepseek · /key set <provider> · /key remove <provider>` |
| Connect preview | `Enter saves route · Esc cancels · /connect custom <id> <base-url> <model-id>` |
| Connect help or saved result | `Next: /connect deepseek · /connect custom <id> <base-url> <model-id>` |
| Saved keys when `GET /v1/auth` is unavailable | `Next: restart backend 0.37.6+ to list saved keys · /help` |
| Concealed key entry | `Paste API key · Enter saves · Esc cancels` |
| API | `Next: /api GET /v1/health · /help for command syntax` |
| Help | `Enter a prompt or choose a /command · Tab completes` |

The transcript is read from projected `MessageInfo.parts` after event
notifications. The TUI does not derive a competing durable state model from
event deltas. List requests follow the server's `page.nextCursor` using the
`page.cursor` and `page.limit` query keys. `GET /v1/auth` is an unpaginated
names-only list. The generic `/api` command sends the supplied JSON unchanged to
the named `/v1` route; its full request and response schemas are in the
[generated API reference](protocol/api-reference.md).
For non-2xx responses with an empty or invalid JSON body, the frontend reports
`METHOD /v1/path: HTTP <status> <status text>`; a structured error envelope
continues to show its code and message.

In gRPC mode, `Events.StreamSessionEvents` takes
`{session: string, sinceSeq: string}` and yields `StreamFrame` values with
`event` or `resync`. The server first replays durable session events with a
sequence greater than `sinceSeq`, then continues with live events; a frame
seen in both feeds is sent once. Permission and question frames remain live
notifications with sequence zero. The TUI cancels the gRPC stream when it
switches sessions or exits. Unary RPC errors map to the same user-facing
HTTP status family used by the existing TUI workflows.
